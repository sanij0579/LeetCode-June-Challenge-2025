solution:

    def robotWithString(self, s: str) -> str:
        from collections import Counter

        # Count frequency of each character in s
        count = Counter(s)
        t = []  # Stack to simulate robot memory
        result = []  # Output written string
        min_char = 'a'  # Start from smallest possible

        for ch in s:
            t.append(ch)
            count[ch] -= 1

            # Update min_char to the next smallest remaining character
            while min_char <= 'z' and count[min_char] == 0:
                min_char = chr(ord(min_char) + 1)

            # While the top of stack is <= smallest remaining char in s
            while t and t[-1] <= min_char:
                result.append(t.pop())

        # Flush remaining stack
        while t:
            result.append(t.pop())

        return ''.join(result)
