1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer
Solution:
class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, num: int) -> int:
        s = str(num)
        
        # For maximum number: replace the first digit that is not '9' with '9'
        for ch in s:
            if ch != '9':
                max_num = int(s.replace(ch, '9'))
                break
        else:
            max_num = num  # all digits are already 9

        # For minimum number: two cases
        if s[0] != '1':
            # If first digit is not '1', replace it with '1' to avoid leading zero
            min_num = int(s.replace(s[0], '1'))
        else:
            # Else, find first digit other than 0 or 1 and replace with 0
            for ch in s[1:]:
                if ch != '0' and ch != '1':
                    min_num = int(s.replace(ch, '0'))
                    break
            else:
                min_num = num  # all digits are 1s or 0s

        return max_num - min_num
