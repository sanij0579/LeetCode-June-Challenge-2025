3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special
Solution:
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        freq = Counter(word)
        freq_values = list(freq.values())
        freq_values.sort()
        
        min_deletions = float('inf')
        
        # Try each frequency as the minimum frequency in the range
        for target in freq_values:
            deletions = 0
            for f in freq_values:
                if f < target:
                    deletions += f  # delete all if too small
                elif f > target + k:
                    deletions += f - (target + k)  # delete excess
                # else within range: keep as is
            min_deletions = min(min_deletions, deletions)
        
        return min_deletions
